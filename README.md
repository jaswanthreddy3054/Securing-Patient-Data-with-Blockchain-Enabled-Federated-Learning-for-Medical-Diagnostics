# Securing-Patient-Data-with-Blockchain-Enabled-Federated-Learning-for-Medical-Diagnostics
A secure medical diagnostic system using Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning, allowing hospitals to train AI models without sharing patient data. Blockchain ensures data integrity, privacy, and trust, enabling accurate diagnostics while preserving confidentiality and meeting compliance standards.
This project focuses on enhancing the privacy and security of patient health data using Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning (FL) in the field of medical diagnostics. Federated Learning allows multiple hospitals or medical institutions to collaboratively train AI models without sharing sensitive patient data. Instead, data remains locally stored while only model updates are exchanged.

To ensure trust, transparency, and integrity in this collaborative process, Blockchain technology is integrated. It provides a secure, decentralized ledger to record model updates and verify participants, preventing tampering and unauthorized access.

By combining FL and Blockchain, the system ensures:

Patient data privacy

Secure model training across institutions

Improved diagnostic accuracy

Compliance with data protection regulations

This approach offers a scalable and secure solution for modern healthcare systems aiming to adopt AI without compromising patient confidentiality.
